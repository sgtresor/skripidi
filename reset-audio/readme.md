# using sony headset on ubuntu os is, need attention
> somehow when in playing game mode or doing alt+tab thingy, the audio is gone temporarily. the (one of) manual fix is reset the type by switching from "headset" to "handsfree" or other way around, then the audio is coming back

this script is basically doing the manual thing by binding it with keyboard shortcut.

how to:
1. take the script
2. make executable
3. run it for testing
4. settings > keyboard shortcuts > customize shortcut. the command in format `bash path_of_where_the_script`
